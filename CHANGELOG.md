## v1.0.0 — 2026-05-19

### Highlights

Smart Router v1.0.0 is the first stable release of Magma's multi-protocol RPC gateway: a single static binary (or multi-arch Docker image) that proxies JSON-RPC, REST, gRPC, and Tendermint RPC traffic against pools of QoS-scored upstream providers. Unlike generic L4/L7 load balancers, the router speaks each chain's wire format and applies RPC-aware semantics — caching by method and parameters, distinguishing transient timeouts from "block not yet produced", retrying against alternate providers on retryable failures, and backing off providers silently serving stale block data while still returning `200 OK`.

Release artifacts ship with a verifiable supply chain: the SHA-256 checksum file is cosign-keyless-signed via GitHub Actions OIDC and Sigstore (no keys to manage; verification recipe in `RELEASING.md`), the multi-arch Docker image lives at `ghcr.io/magma-devs/smart-router:v1.0.0`, and native binaries target `GOAMD64=v3` (Haswell+) and `GOARM64=v8.2` (ARMv8.2+) for modern hardware.
